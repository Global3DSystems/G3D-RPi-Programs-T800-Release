### My updates failed, what to do?

* If the usb update has been interrupted due to power interruption, 
you can simply update it again by just turning on the printer and the usb plugged in.
* If the over the air download update has been interrupted due to power interruption,
you can simply repeat the process again when printer turns on or update via USB.
* If you cannot download updates due to slow connection, use USB update instead.
Program won't allow downloads when you have less than 100 kbps download speed.
* If download stucks, you probably have slow internet, consider using USB update only.
